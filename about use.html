    <p>This website was my very first project, created as part of my early learning journey in web development. Although it may not be perfect or highly polished, it represents the beginning of my efforts to build useful and interactive web pages.

        The project focuses on a simple college webpage, showcasing basic features like image display, navigation, and forms. It helped me understand important concepts such as HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript validation.
        
        I am continuously learning and improving my skills, and this project holds a special place as the starting point of my web development path. Thank you for visiting and supporting my growth!</p>
